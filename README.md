I'm a passionate individual with a strong interest in data science and machine learning. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation, holding a BSc Hons degree with second upper honors in Science and Management, with a focus on industrial statistics and mathematical finance from the University of Colombo.

Throughout my educational and professional experiences, I've discovered my genuine passion for working with data. I find immense joy in exploring and analyzing data, unraveling valuable insights, and applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges. This enthusiasm has led me to delve deeper into the realms of data science and machine learning, where I've found a perfect blend of science, mathematics, and practical problem-solving.

I am continually seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in data science, and I'm excited to be a part of the ever-evolving field that empowers us to make informed decisions, discover patterns, and create innovative solutions.
